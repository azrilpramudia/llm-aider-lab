# LLM Aider Lab

This repository serves as a laboratory for experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Aider tool. It's a space for developing, testing, and understanding the capabilities of LLMs in code generation, refactoring, and other programming tasks.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this lab is to:
- Explore different use cases for LLMs in software development.
- Practice and refine prompts for Aider and other LLM-powered coding assistants.
- Document findings, best practices, and challenges encountered during experimentation.
- Share examples of LLM-assisted coding workflows.

## Getting Started

To get started with this lab, you will need to have Aider installed and configured with your preferred LLM.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/azrilpramudia/llm-aider-lab.git
    cd llm-aider-lab
    ```

2.  **Install Aider (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://aider.chat/install.sh | sh
    ```
    Alternatively, you can install with pip:
    ```bash
    pip install aider-chat
    ```
    For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please refer to the [Aider documentation](https://aider.chat/).

3.  **Start experimenting!**
    You can use Aider to interact with the files in this repository, practice refactoring, generate new code, or test different prompts.
